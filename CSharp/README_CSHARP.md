# Sonic Scout C# Edition

This folder now contains a native Windows WPF version of the Sonic Scout profile manager.

## Start the app

Double-click `run_sonic_scout_csharp.bat`.

The launcher builds the app automatically the first time, then starts:

```text
bin\Release\net8.0-windows\SonicScout.exe
```

A .NET 8 SDK is required to build from source. The published folder can run without the SDK when the .NET 8 desktop runtime is installed.

## What it does

- Selects the three existing EQ profiles in `profiles\`.
- Copies the selected profile to `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\HAudioApp\active_profile.txt`.
- Equalizer APO can include that active file from its `config.txt`.
- Displays chain status and reports write errors in the app.
- Includes Singularity Camo, Dark Matter, Borealis, Abyss, Apocalypse, Brutalist, Instrument, and Psychotic theme choices.

## Setup wizard routing flow

- `SETUP` now runs an installation-style routing wizard.
- The wizard discovers active output endpoints and asks you to select your default physical output.
- The wizard requires explicit ownership/apply confirmations before it can write routing configuration.
- The wizard includes Sonic Scout routing profiles (`Sonic Scout Direct Route` and `Sonic Scout Compatibility Route`).
- It saves compatibility flags for Voicemeeter, Elgato Wave Link, Creative Sound Blaster, or similar mixers.
- It provisions the `Sonic Scout` virtual route when a compatible Hi-Fi/virtual cable endpoint is present.
- If no compatible tuned-channel route exists, setup calls out Voicemeeter / VB-Cable prerequisites so the tuned channel can still be created.
- If no compatible virtual cable endpoint is available, routing safely falls back to the selected physical output.

## Guided dependency installer order (tester flow)

Use `run_audio_stack_setup.bat` to run the staged install flow with consent prompts and verification logs.

## Sonic Scout SonicPass

`SonicPass\SonicScout.SonicPass.csproj` builds the Sonic Scout user-mode audio pass. It captures audio from the selected virtual endpoint (either a dedicated capture/recording endpoint or a render loopback) and sends it directly to the selected physical output, so Voicemeeter is not required.

Build or run it with:

```text
CSharp\run_scoutpass.bat
```

SonicPass still needs a virtual audio driver such as VB-Cable because a normal WPF application cannot create a Windows audio endpoint by itself. Use the `SCOUTPASS` panel in the main window after running `SETUP`; it selects the virtual input and physical output, applies input/output boost, sets the buffer, and starts or stops the pass. EQ processing and device-loss recovery remain separate follow-up layers.

### Lifecycle

- Sonic Scout automatically starts SonicPass once a valid saved route exists, right after startup finishes refreshing device state.
- Closing the main window now performs a real shutdown: it stops the audio monitor and any running SonicPass process before the app exits. It no longer minimizes to tray on close.
- Equalizer APO is a system-wide audio filter, not a process Sonic Scout starts or stops; only SonicPass is owned and managed by the app's lifecycle.

### SonicPass install order

1. Equalizer APO
2. VB-Cable base route (if no tuned virtual route is detected)
3. Hi-Fi Cable route (if missing)
4. Voicemeeter fallback (optional, prompted when tuned route is still missing)
5. Final verification and fallback safety checks

### SonicPass assets and logs

Place installer files in `CSharp\installers\` before running the setup script.

Logs are written to:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\SonicScout\logs\
```

including JSON run reports and a rolling history file.

The setup verifier checks the actual Equalizer APO configuration/runtime files,
active Windows audio endpoints, installer exit codes, and the Windows Audio
service. A generic virtual cable endpoint is sufficient for the safe fallback
route; a dedicated Hi-Fi Cable endpoint is reported as an optional quality
upgrade rather than treated as a failed installation.

## Equalizer APO setup

Add this line once to Equalizer APO's configuration file, using the exact path shown below:

```text
Include: C:\Users\<your-user>\Documents\HAudioApp\active_profile.txt
```

Select a profile in Sonic Scout after changing the active profile. No administrator access is required because the active file lives in Documents.

## Build a distributable folder

```powershell
dotnet publish CSharp\SonicScout.CSharp.csproj --configuration Release --runtime win-x64 --self-contained false --output "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\SonicScout"

Copy-Item profiles\*.txt "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\SonicScout\profiles" -Force
```

Copy the complete `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\SonicScout` folder to another Windows machine with the .NET 8 Desktop Runtime installed.
